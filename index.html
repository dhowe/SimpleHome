  <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>👋</span> Hello, I'm Daniel</h2>

  <p>I'm a student at UAL studying Creative Computing. I have a background in architecture and I'm interested in the intersection of art and tech., exploring how surveillance can be critiqued through interactive art. I'm passionate about using technology to create meaningful and thought-provoking art that challenges our perceptions of privacy.</p>

  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  For my final project I'm thinking about making an interactive map of surveillance cameras in London art schools. My
  prototype will be UAL. After reading and coding this week, I had several realisations about surveillance. It could be
  argued that, surveillance. art, or more specifically geometrical, non-figurative visual art, does not have a set of
  all-encompassing and inclusive principles that determines what creates aesthetically pleasing images and what does
  not. Despite the result of psychological tests suggesting there might be a common quality yet to be discovered in our
  reactions to surveillance, I have a strong belief that such underlying principles can be found using systematic and
  scientific approach. I’m not convinced…
