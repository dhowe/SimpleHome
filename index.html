	<h2>Project Idea</h2>
	For my final project I'm thinking about making an interactive map of surveillance cameras in London art schools. My
	prototype will be UAL. After reading and coding this week, I had several realisations about surveillance. It could be
	argued that, surveillance. art, or more specifically geometrical, non-figurative visual art, does not have a set of
	all-encompassing and inclusive principles that determines what creates aesthetically pleasing images and what does
	not. Despite the result of psychological tests suggesting there might be a common quality yet to be discovered in our
	reactions to surveillance, I have a strong belief that such underlying principles can be found using systematic and
	scientific approach. I’m not convinced…
